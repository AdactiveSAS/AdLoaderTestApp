#Run

- npm run build 
-> Will build you app with electron on top of it : Note : it will be build in 64 by default

- npm run install

Once the app is build, this command will package it and create an "installer". I can't make the msi installer work


#Configuration

Please set in package.json the following fields : 

- name : The name will be user for your exe name 


- icon : You can cahnge the icon of the application by changing the one in asset folder
